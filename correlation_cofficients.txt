One of the hypothesis says that there is no correlation between consecutive
prime gaps. We can use Pearson correlation coefficient to check the linear
correlation between consecutive gaps. R provides a function to calculate the
linear correlation, cor(). It takes two vectors as inputs and returns a value
of linear correlation. The value of correlation coefficient varies between 0
and 1. The 0 value means that there is no correlation and 1 is otherwise. We 
input first and second prime gaps as first and second vectors, respectively.
The return value (i.e. 0.24 as shown in graph) is equal to zero because of the
following reason.

We found a plausible explanation for this fact in that we have larger gaps if
the input is larger. That means that if the first gap is larger, the next gap
has a higher probability of being relatively large too. Considering this,
indeed we should expect some correlation. However, we could perform a separate
experiment without this bias, by considering only similar inputs. But it was
limited by time constraint.
